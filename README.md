Some Nomad

Oh, love of mine

With a song and a whine

You're harsh and divine

Like truths and a lie


But the tale ends not here

I have nothing to fear

For my love is yell of giving and hold on


And the bright emptiness

In a room full of it

Is a cruel mistress

Whoa oh!


I feel this unrest

That nests all hollowness

For I have nowhere to go and I'm cold.


And I feel so lonely yeah...

There's a better place than this

Emptiness

And I'm so lonely yeah...

There's a better place than this

Emptiness, yeah!
